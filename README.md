i really struggled to get my code running, it was a battle between going completely with chatGpt or using it to code along in a way that i will understand what im doing, i chose the latter and i humbly admit that i still have not quite gotten the hang of web component, i will however continue working on this project to grasp the concept

i have however made an impprovement to my project, where my initial submission showed nothing on the browser, my current progress on the project now shows the HTML structure and CSS styling on the browser, i really do appreciate the challenges it has given me and still does give me.
